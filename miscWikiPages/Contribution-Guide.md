# Contribution Guide

For wiki contributions, try to keep markdown files out of 
the miscWikiPages folder. This folder is for wiki files that 
don't belong to a folder in the code.

Try to write tests for the updates you made.

Write and maintain JSDoc comments.

Check if the documentation build (`gulp wiki-build`) is good 
and the tests pass (`gulp test`, `env-test-server` and `env-staging-server`) pass.
 
To update the wiki, you must push to the wiki repo.
 
Writing manual tests would be nice, but not expected. You can
 read more about manual tests [here.](https://github.com/petekeller2/epilogue-starter-kit/wiki/Manual-Tests)
