# Contribution Guide

For wiki contributions, try to keep markdown files out of 
the miscWikiPages folder.

Try to write tests for the updates you made.

Write and maintain JSDoc comments.

Check if the documentation build (`gulp wiki-build`is good and the tests pass (`env-test-server` and 
 `env-staging-server`) pass. For the tests, you can skip http
 tests for now as they are broken.
 
To update the wiki, you must push to the wiki repo.
 
Writing manual tests would be nice, but not expected. You can
 read more about manual tests [here.](https://github.com/petekeller2/epilogue-starter-kit/wiki/Manual-Tests)
