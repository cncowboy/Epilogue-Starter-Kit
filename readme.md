# Epilogue Starter Kit

A starter kit using an Express implementation of Epilogue. It handles
generic functionality like authentication and authorization 
as well as potentially repetitive tasks like setting up 
Epilogue resources and milestones. This starter kit is a work 
in progress and any pull requests are welcome.

# Getting Started

Run `gulp env-staging-server` and `gulp env-test-server` to see 
if Epilogue Starter Kit is working properly locally. If it is not, check 
that you have babel and gulp installed. Also check if the 
npm libraries needed were installed (`npm install`).

If everything is working, you can start by editing the files or 
adding folders to the resources folder. To learn more about resources 
in Epilogue Starter Kit, [read this.](https://github.com/petekeller2/epilogue-starter-kit/wiki/Resources)You 
should read Epilogue's documentation as well to fully understand resources 
and milestones.

Start using `npm start` or `npm run serve` for the built version (`npm run build` to build).
