A starter kit using an Express implementation of Epilogue. It handles
generic functionality like authentication and authorization 
as well as potentially repetitive tasks like setting up 
Epilogue resources and milestones.

# Getting Started

Run `gulp env-staging-server` and `gulp env-test-server` to see 
if Epilogue Starter Kit is working properly locally. If it is not, check 
that you have babel and gulp installed. Also check if the 
npm libraries needed were installed (`npm install`).

If everything is working, you can start by adding or editing 
resources in the resources folder. To learn more about resources 
in Epilogue Starter Kit, [read this.](https://github.com/petekeller2/epilogue-starter-kit/wiki/Resources) 
You should read Epilogue's documentation as well to fully understand resources 
and milestones.

Start using `npm start` or `npm run serve` for the built version (`npm run build` to build).
